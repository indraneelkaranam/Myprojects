Introducing Monthly Bike Renting Subscription
Renting a bike everyday might seem like a task for many. So, we introduced a monthly subscription package which allows you to be flexible and rent a bike for a month or maybe more. You can rent a two wheeler online on monthly, quarterly, half yearly or yearly basis. From an hour to a year, motorbike rental was never so flexible.
